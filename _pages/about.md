👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD student at NC State University.

📚  My academic pursuits revolve around Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and 3D Geometry.

🔬 I am engaged in ***PhD research*** that explores 3D Reconstruction through the use of ***Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)*** and ***Gaussian splatting***, with a particular emphasis on ***multi-view geometry***. A key aspect of my work is ***predicting orientation*** based on camera parameters to improve reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, I focus on optimizing camera poses with uncertainty to eliminate noise and enhance the overall quality of the reconstructions.

## 🔍 Looking for Opportunities

I am actively seeking **Internship opportunities from Summer 2025**. My expertise and interests lie in the following areas:

Machine Learning

Computer Vision/ Image Processing

3D Reconstruction

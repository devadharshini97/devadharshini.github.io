👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year graduate student at NC State University.

📚  My academic pursuits revolve around Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning and 3D Geometry.

🔬 Within the realm of research, I am currently engrossed in my **Master's Thesis**, exploring 3D Reconstruction through the application of ***Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)*** and emphasizing ***multi-view geometry***. My work involves optimizing camera poses to intricately enhance the quality of reconstructions. I have also worked with **V2X Perception** models.

## 🔍 Looking for Opportunities

I am actively seeking full-time opportunities beginning Summer 2024 and internship opportunities for Spring 2024. My expertise and interests lie in the following areas:

Machine Learning

Computer Vision/ Image Processing

3D Reconstruction

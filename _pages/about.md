👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year graduate student at NC State University.

📚  My academic pursuits revolve around Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Co-operative V2X Perception.

🔬 Within the realm of research, I am currently engrossed in my Master's Thesis, exploring 3D Reconstruction through the application of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and emphasizing multi-view geometry. My work involves optimizing camera poses to intricately enhance the quality of reconstructions.

## 🔍 Looking for Opportunities

I am actively seeking full-time opportunities beginning Summer 2024 and internship opportunities for Spring 2024. My expertise and interests lie in the following areas:

Machine Learning
Computer Vision/ Image Processing
3D Reconstruction

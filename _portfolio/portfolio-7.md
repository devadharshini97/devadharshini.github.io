## Project Description:
For the "Random Processes" course final project, I implemented a GUI application to visualize the simulation, transformation, and convergence of random variables, exploring key statistical concepts.

### Random Variable Simulation:

Generated random variables from diverse distributions (normal, uniform, exponential) using MATLAB routines and envelope rejection methods.
Computed and compared mean and variance for simulated distributions, assessing variance between simulated and theoretical values.

### Transformation and Convergence:

Transformed X random variates for different distributions (normal, uniform, exponential) with varying sample sizes (100, 1000, 10000).
Investigated modes of convergence (Mean Square, Almost Sure, Probability, Distribution) to comprehend the law of large numbers.

## GUI Visualization:

Developed a graphical user interface (GUI) to illustrate the convergence of Y random variates towards their mean.
Showcased convergences including Probability, Almost Sure, Mean Square, and Distribution convergence.
Demonstrated the Weak Law of Large Numbers for X variates within the same interactive GUI environment.

This project not only delves into the practical application of random processes but also provides an interactive tool for visually grasping the convergence behaviors of transformed random variables, contributing to a deeper understanding of statistical principles.

<p>Conducted comprehensive data analysis, preprocessing, and partitioning of the BRaTS2021 dataset to facilitate the
    creation of a 3D tumor segmentation algorithm through deep learning. Implemented training procedures for the Vnet
    architecture, optimizing its performance for accurate segmentation. Additionally, investigated the application of an
    attention-based feature extractor using Unetr for enhanced 3D brain tumor segmentation. To facilitate easy visual
    analysis, generated cloud point visualizations of both predictions and ground truth.</p>

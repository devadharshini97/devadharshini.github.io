This project addresses the pervasive issue of credit card fraud by developing an advanced fraud detection system. Leveraging a Kaggle dataset, which includes a highly unbalanced distribution of frauds (0.172% of transactions), the project employs resampling and synthetic data generation techniques. 

Various resampling methods, such as ADASYN and SMOTE, are explored, alongside feature selection methods and the Decision Tree classifier. 

The dataset, consisting of credit card transactions from September 2013, is processed, and different data balancing techniques, including undersampling and oversampling, are analyzed. 

The experimentation involves the application of balanced cross-entropy, SMOTE, ADASYN, random undersampling, centroid clustering, and focal loss. 

The project compares the performance of oversampled data on models like XGBoost, Ensemble2, and Ensemble3. Additionally, the implementation extends to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), assessing their effectiveness with and without data resampling. 

Hypotheses are formulated, and various models are tested and compared, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, ensemble methods, and deep learning architectures. 

The results indicate the effectiveness of oversampling techniques in addressing class imbalance and enhancing fraud detection, with Ensemble models and deep learning architectures demonstrating promising results. 

The project contributes insights into optimizing fraud detection in imbalanced datasets through a combination of resampling methods and advanced machine learning models.

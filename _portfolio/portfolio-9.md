The motivation behind the Cloud-Based Camera Security System project arises from the pressing demand for cutting-edge security solutions in residential and commercial settings. With a focus on enhancing safety, privacy, and scalability, the project combines state-of-the-art camera technology with cloud computing to empower property owners for efficient monitoring and security. It revolutionizes security provision, offering user-centric, privacy-aware, and feature-rich systems, marking a significant leap towards a safer and interconnected world.

## Project Requirements:
Addressing the rising need for advanced security solutions, the Cloud-Based Camera Security System project focuses on developing a sophisticated system that integrates camera technology with cloud computing. The goal is to empower property owners to monitor and secure their premises effectively. The system provides valuable facilities such as remote monitoring, real-time alerts, automated intruder detection analysis, 24/7 security management, integration with law enforcement, and data backup.

## Implementation:
For the initial phase, the project implemented a key technical requirement: achieving 99% system availability. This was accomplished by utilizing Amazon EKS, creating nodes, deploying pods, connecting to a load balancer, and conducting load testing with Locust. Additionally, Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) was applied to dynamically scale resources based on varying load conditions. This successful implementation marks a crucial step in fulfilling the broader objectives of the Cloud-Based Camera Security System.
